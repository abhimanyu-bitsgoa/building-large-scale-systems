        "follower_count": "Original had 5 followers ($60/hr, over budget — INC-5). 3 followers costs $40/hr (within $50 budget) and still allows floor(3/2)=1 failure tolerance.",
        "rate_limiting": "Original window was 2 seconds — resets so fast that sustained bursts were never blocked (INC-1). 60s window with max=10 properly throttles flash-sale bot traffic while allowing normal browsing.",
        "auto_spawn": "Original delay was 1 second — so aggressive that a slow heartbeat on a congested link caused ghost nodes (INC-2). 5s delay gives enough time for transient network issues to resolve before triggering respawn."
