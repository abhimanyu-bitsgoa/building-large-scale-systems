# Example Student Configuration
# Copy this file and modify the values for your assessment

cluster:
  # Number of follower nodes to spawn
  followers: 3
  
  # Write quorum (W): number of followers that must acknowledge a write
  # Must be <= followers for writes to succeed
  write_quorum: 2
  
  # Read quorum (R): number of followers to query for reads
  # Higher R = stronger consistency but higher latency
  read_quorum: 1

gateway:
  # Enable rate limiting at the gateway
  rate_limit_enabled: true
  
  # Maximum requests allowed per window
  rate_limit_max: 15
  
  # Window size in seconds
  rate_limit_window: 30

  Configuration Rationale:
  
  1. Cluster Setup (W=2, R=1, 3 followers):
     - With 3 followers and W=2, I can tolerate 1 follower failure
       while still meeting write quorum.
     - R=1 provides fast reads with eventual consistency, suitable
       for read-heavy workloads where strong consistency isn't critical.
  
  2. Rate Limiting (15 requests per 30 seconds):
     - Protects the cluster from burst traffic and DoS attacks.
     - Window of 30s is short enough to recover quickly.
     - 15 requests allows reasonable throughput per client.
  
  Trade-offs:
  - Lower R means reads might return stale data during replication lag.
  - Could increase R to 2 for stronger consistency if needed.
